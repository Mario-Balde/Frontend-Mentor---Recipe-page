### What I learned
From the provided HTML and CSS, I've learned how to build and style a simple web page using foundational web development techniques. I've demonstrated the ability to structure content semantically with HTML, including headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images. On the CSS side, I've applied basic styling, such as controlling typography, colours, padding, margins, and element sizing. Additionally, I've utilized CSS to enhance visual aesthetics by adding rounded corners, customizing list markers, and ensuring proper spacing within elements.


### Continued development
I'm excited to dive deeper into CSS and expand my skills by learning Flexbox and Grid. While I've enjoyed using traditional CSS techniques for layout and styling, Flexbox and Grid offer powerful tools for creating more flexible, responsive, and efficient designs. I'm eager to explore how these modern layout methods can simplify the process of aligning and distributing content, making my web designs even more dynamic and user-friendly. Learning Flexbox and Grid will be a significant step forward in my journey to becoming a more proficient and versatile front-end developer.
